        <p>The Big Academy is a recruitment platform which allows users to register, post vacancies, search vacancies and apply for them. Candidates can create profiles which act as a digital CV to promote themselves to employers in a modern and innovative way. The site also offers candidates career advice as well as a range of tools to help them in their working life such as a budget calculator, calendar and diary. I was responsible for coding up both the front and back end, as well as designing the database and managing a VPS used to host the site. At its core the site is powered by the CodeIgniter PHP framework with a MySQL database. This has been one of my largest projects to date and I'm currently still working on further developing the site.</p>

        <p>Mayfield manufacture bespoke bell lyres to raise money for the Autism Plus charity, they wanted to expand their sales by launching an e-commerce site. Whilst working with their in house team my role was to code the front end to match a design provided and develop the back end to allow users to browse a catalogue of products and purchase them online. I constructed the front end with Foundation, giving me the opportunity to get to grips with using a responsive layout. Whilst employing Drupal and Ubercart for the back end with additional modifications to add custom functionality. I also had fun writing some challenging custom jQuery animations. Mayfield is a culmination of my skills and one of my proudest pieces of work to date.</p>

        <p>Independent Executives provides part time executives and experts to small businesses. They wanted a site to effectively promote their services whilst being easy to update and manage by their staff. At the time I'd been learning the ins and outs of WordPress so I decided to put these skills to use on this project. I created a bespoke WordPress theme to match a design provided. I also developed a custom plugin which used the Google Maps API to allow a user to type in their postcode and find the closest Independent Executives offices to them. Through my contribution to this project I got the opportunity to significantly expand and improve my knowledge of WordPress; from template creation to plugin development.</p>

        <h3 class="project-title">Stratify</h3>
        <p>Stratify is an online community for individuals with autism across Sheffield. The site aims to give them a chance to socialise and have their say on local issues. This project involved creating a custom template for phpBB based on a design given by the client. Several modifications were made to the functionality of phpBB to adapt the platform to meet the needs of the project. I integrated and adapted several open-source plugins including a CMS to make updating the content simple and quick. Due to the target audience of the site accessibility concerns had to be taken into account. Having not had a chance to work on a forum for a while this was a fun project to be a part of and gave me the opportunity to familiarise myself with phpBB.</p>

        <h3 class="project-title">Funded Learning</h3>
        <p>Funded Learning offers marketing services to colleges to help them find learners. Having worked with this client in the past they approached me to create a new site. They wanted a site which was less corporate and more fun to reflect their company culture. The site needed to function on many different devices, be easy to update with the latest company information and be accessible for both users and search engines. The site also needed to include profiles for each team member with a photo and some fun facts. Using Drupal I developed a custom theme to match exacting details of a design to build a website to promote their company. In order to allow the site to adapt to mobile and tablet devices I made use of a responsive grid.</p>

        <p>MyLife was a prototype online tool aimed at helping young people with learning difficulties succeed in the world of work. The platform enabled users to register an account, create a profile, upload photos and videos, get advice and guidance and browse a directory of local organisations. They could apply for job opportunities and search for accommodation. Useful tools such as a budget calculator were available to users. Organisations were also able to register an account in order to advertise their services and opportunities. I undertook development of the front and back end making extensive use of CodeIgniter. It was a huge, challenging, but ultimately enjoyable project to be a part of.</p>

    <h3 class="skills-title">Front End Development</h3>
    <p>Turning great web designs into functional and effective websites; it's what I do! I write standards compliant, accessible and cross browser HTML5 and CSS3 with a focus on semantic markup that's easy to read and maintain. By using a responsive layout, with progressive enhancement techniques, I create sites which allow the user to experience them in the most appropriate way suited to the device they are using. A good knowledge of JavaScript allows me to add additional functionality and user interactive features.</p>

    <h3 class="skills-title">Back End Development</h3>
    <p>As a backend web developer and Software Engineering graduate I have the ability to build complex interactive sites and applications which utilize PHP and MySQL. Organisation and structure is given to my code through use of patterns and models such as OOP, MVC and ORM. Performance and quality is ensured through use of unit testing at each stage of a project. By using database design principles, including normalisation, I build well-structured databases that don't suffer from common pitfalls such as data redundancy and duplication.</p>

    <p>Although not strictly a web designer I still have a solid working knowledge of Photoshop and know the difference between good and bad design practices. Furthermore, in some of my roles I've been responsible for providing hosting, as such I've learned the core skills needed to set up and manage a web server. Specifically I work with Apache on a regular basis. For many of my projects I also make use of open-source libraries, frameworks and CMS platforms. I'm a frequent user of SASS and jQuery, but I use lots of others including CodeIgniter, Drupal and WordPress.</p>

  <div class="bio-text-wrap">
    <p>I'm a Sheffield based web developer with a passion for writing clean and beautiful code. I've been building websites since high school back in the days when tables and animated GIFs were cool. As a Software Engineering graduate with over 5 years commercial experience I've built up a broad technical skills set.</p>
    <p>I love a good coding challenge and constantly on the lookout for opportunities to learn new things, I can often be found in my room meddling with a new library or framework. I'm always keen to try out upcoming standards and technologies like HTML5 and CSS3 and from time-to-time I like to work on some fun personal projects. I've worked on a wide range of different projects giving me plenty of opportunities to advance both my personal and technical skills.</p>
    <p>In my offline life I'm quite the film buff with a particular interest in comic book movies and other geeky franchises. I'm also a bit of an adrenaline junkie; I enjoy visiting theme parks and even built up the courage to throw myself out of a plane.</p>
